                            Hello! I'm Nilrudra Mukhopadhyay, a passionate programmer with a focus on modern data management and application developement. 
                            I love building intuitive and performance oriented applications. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching sports, and traveling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the duration of this course, I hope to achieve a deeper understanding of modern web development practices, improve my 
                            ability to write clean and efficient code, and gain a hands-on experience with real-world projects. I also aim to enhance my problem-solving 
                            skills and build a website that can add to my portfolio of work that showcases my progress. Additionally, I look forward to learning 
                            best practices for debugging, optimizing performance, and deploying applications successfully.

                            One of my favorite movies of all time, is available on our dataset:
                            <Link href={`/movies/${title}`} passHref legacyBehavior>
                                <a style={{marginLeft: '5px'}}>{title}</a>
                            </Link>
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <MovieDetails movie={movie}/>
                    </Card.Body>
                </Card>
            </Container>
        </>
    );
};
